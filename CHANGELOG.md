# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Hyprland window focus now tries three strategies in order: the Lua
  dispatcher (only when the IPC hl global is the API table -- Hyprland
  0.56.2 ships hl as boolean true, so it is probed once via
  hyprctl repl type(hl) and skipped when unusable), wlrctl toplevel
  focus by Wayland app-id resolved from hyprctl clients -j, then the
  legacy hyprctl dispatch focuswindow. All attempts are reported when
  every strategy fails.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Window listing and exact focus on niri through `niri msg`, with direct
  JSON IPC as a fallback when the CLI is unavailable. Socket discovery
  matches the current Wayland display and refuses ambiguous sessions.
  Focus is verified with a fresh window query before targeted input.
  Window bounds account for output scaling and window offsets. Missing
  positions stay null; unknown or mixed scaling omits bounds. (#192)

## [0.7.6] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- Wayland `press_key` on the remote-desktop portal now sends modifiers and
  named keys (Enter, arrows, F-keys and the rest) as keysyms, so the
  compositor resolves them against the active keymap. With Caps Lock and
  Control swapped, `Ctrl+A` used to press the physical Control position,
  which toggled Caps Lock and typed `A`. It now selects all. Letters and
  digits stay physical keycodes: mutter drops a keysym missing from the
  current layout group, so a keysym `a` would vanish under a Hebrew or
  Cyrillic layout, and GTK and Qt match shortcuts on those layouts by the
  US keycode. KDE Plasma keeps keycodes for now. (#191)

## [0.7.5] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- Opt-in persistence for the Wayland remote-desktop portal. Set
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_PERSIST_REMOTE_DESKTOP=1` to send `persist_mode=2`
  on `RemoteDesktop.SelectDevices` and reuse the single-use `restore_token`
  returned by `Start`. Nothing persistence-related is sent on
  `ScreenCast.SelectSources` (that call rejects it for a remote-desktop
  session). Pointer and keyboard sessions store separate tokens, mode
  `0600`, under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/computer-use-linux/` or
  `~/.local/state/computer-use-linux/`. The first grant still shows the
  dialog. Later processes restore until the desktop revokes the grant, or
  until the token cannot be restored, which falls back to a prompt.
  Interface version 2 is required. Unset, behavior is unchanged. (#185)

### Fixed
- X11 `scroll` no longer follows ydotool's absolute move with a single wheel
  event. That move warps the pointer through (0, 0). GTK 3 resets its XI2
  scroll valuators when the pointer re-enters the window, so the one wheel
  event only re-baselines them and the window does not move, while the tool
  still returns success. Native X11 now sends the same notch count as XTEST
  wheel buttons through xdotool (4 up, 5 down, 6 left, 7 right), which have
  no scroll valuators. Wayland portal scroll is unchanged. (#184)

## [0.7.4] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed
- The #167 index check no longer trusts a pid the snapshot did not match.
  When `get_app_state` named a pid with no accessibility root plus an app
  name, the tree came from the app-name match but was recorded under the
  requested pid. An index from that tree then passed a click aimed at the
  requested pid and was refused for the app that owns it. The snapshot now
  records a pid only when its roots were selected by that pid; otherwise each
  node is checked against its owner on the accessibility bus.

## [0.7.3] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed
- `click` and `scroll` by `element_index` or selector now refuse an index from
  another app's snapshot. `get_app_state` records the pid it snapshotted;
  when the action's target resolves to a different pid, the call fails and
  asks for a `get_app_state` of the target, instead of acting on the other
  app's node and reporting `ok: true`. An untargeted snapshot mixes apps, so
  its node is checked against the pid that owns it on the accessibility bus.
  (#167)
- Portal pointer input on scaled GNOME Wayland (for example 125 %) now lands
  where it is aimed. mutter maps a stream point to `monitor.x + stream_x /
  scale` when its layout mode is logical, which is the GNOME 50 default, so
  logical coordinates arrived at 1/scale of the target and still reported
  success. The pointer path reads the layout mode from
  `org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig` and sends each stream's point multiplied
  by its monitor scale. Click, scroll, and drag share the path. Unscaled
  monitors, physical layout mode, and other compositors are unchanged. (#169)
- The Pi extension falls back to `computer-use-linux` on `PATH` when neither
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_BIN` nor the downloaded package binary is available.
  Temporary extensions (`pi -e npm:@agent-sh/computer-use-linux`) are staged
  without that binary and warned "binary not found" even with a global
  install. The PATH lookup was dropped in the native-tools rewrite. (#170)
- `type_text` and `press_key` no longer warn "no focused element" when the
  focus probe merely ran out of budget. The 400-node search now reports when a
  node, depth, or read limit stopped it, and the feedback says the input could
  not be verified instead. With a target pid, the probe searches only that
  app; when no AT-SPI app belongs to it (xterm, Electron without
  `--force-renderer-accessibility`), feedback says so instead of warning or
  reporting another app's focused widget. (#168)
- KDE Plasma clipboard paste into xterm, uxterm, rxvt, urxvt, and koi8rxterm
  now sends Shift+Insert. Those terminals have no Ctrl+Shift+V binding by
  default, so the paste was dropped; Klipper sets the selection as well as
  the clipboard, so Shift+Insert pastes the new text. When AT-SPI reports a
  focused element that is not a terminal (a search field in a terminal
  window), paste falls back to Ctrl+V. The check reads the AT-SPI role enum,
  not the localized role name. Behavior ported from
  ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux#1413.
- Helper spawns (ydotool, wtype, xdotool, gnome-screenshot, and every command
  run through the supervised runner) retry a transient `ETXTBSY` ("Text file
  busy") for up to 75 ms. The error appears when a helper binary is being
  replaced, and it made xdotool fall back to ydotool as if it were missing.
  It also made tests that write and exec fake helper scripts fail under the
  parallel suite, which failed the first v0.7.2 tag run.

## [0.7.2] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- Native X11 screenshot route: one `GetImage` on the root window over the
  X11 connection, used only on a native X11 session (never XWayland) and
  tried after GNOME Shell and the portal, before `gnome-screenshot`.
  Pixels are device pixels, the space xdotool input and X11 window origins
  use. MATE/X11 had no working route: xdg-desktop-portal-gtk has no
  Screenshot, and gnome-screenshot 41 blacks out 3/4 of the frame at
  window-scaling-factor 2. `doctor` reports the route as
  `platform.x11_display` and `capabilities.screenshot` entry `x11`;
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_SCREENSHOT_BACKEND=x11` pins it. (#155)

### Fixed
- `doctor` no longer reports the XDG Screenshot, ScreenCast, or InputCapture
  portal as available when the portal does not export that interface.
  `busctl introspect` exits 0 with only a header line for a missing interface,
  so each entry now requires its methods (Screenshot: `Screenshot`). Readiness
  gains `can_capture_screenshots` and a blocker when no screenshot route is
  detected; this is detection, not a test capture. (#156)
- X11/EWMH window origins now come from the X server
  (`TranslateCoordinates` to the root window) instead of `wmctrl -lG`, which
  counts the client's offset inside its frame twice. Window-targeted
  screenshots cropped the wrong area, relative clicks were offset by the same
  amount, off-screen warnings misfired on maximized windows, and
  `move_window` reported a mismatch after a correct move. Bounds are the
  client area; `move_window` now verifies the frame origin it requested. When
  the X server cannot be asked, the origin is reported unknown instead of the
  shifted wmctrl value. (#157)

## [0.7.1] - 2026-09-19

### Changed
- `get_app_state` now returns its screenshot as a structured `image` content
  block (the same shape as the `screenshot` tool) followed by the JSON report
  as text and `structuredContent`. The JSON `screenshot` field keeps the
  metadata (dimensions, scale, format, bytes) but no longer embeds the base64
  `data_url`, which hosts were counting as ~30K text tokens per call. Callers
  that read `screenshot.data_url` from the JSON should read the image block
  instead. (#145)

### Fixed
- `type_text` on X11 no longer delivers characters out of order. The xdotool
  backend passed `--delay 0`, which lets XTEST key events race each other on
  some X servers (seen on Cinnamon / Mint 22). It now uses xdotool's 12ms
  per-character default and scales the command timeout with text length.
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_XDOTOOL_TYPE_DELAY_MS` overrides the delay. (#147)
- The unscoped-tree warning from `get_app_state` no longer tells a caller that
  already passed a `pid` or window target to pass a target. When the target
  matched no AT-SPI application root, the warning now points at the app's
  missing accessibility support, `list_apps`, and a lower `max_nodes` instead.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added
- `get_app_state` reports `tree_scoped` and `accessibility_tree_truncated`,
  warns in `message` when no app target narrowed the AT-SPI tree to one app,
  and documents every scoping parameter in its schema, the server
  instructions, the skill, and the Pi guide. Unscoped calls used to return the
  whole desktop tree silently and could exhaust a small context window.

### Fixed
- Skill Install section now separates Pi native install from PATH CLI/MCP
  install, so `pi install` is not described as sufficient for shell `doctor`
  and `setup`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- GTK4 delivered-event coordinate probe and an opt-in GTK3/MCP semantic-click
  regression that verifies actual button activation at scales 1 and 2.
- Explicit foreground `guard-accessibility` command with a passive AT-SPI
  listener and verified GNOME toolkit-accessibility reassertion. Ctrl-C or
  SIGTERM stops the guard without disabling other accessibility clients or
  restoring an old saved setting. Never started automatically by MCP or setup.
- Optional `complete_interaction` MCP notification, enabled by
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_NOTIFY_ON_COMPLETE=1`, with bounded notification execution
  and graceful handling of unavailable desktop notification services.

### Fixed
- KDE Plasma terminal paste uses terminal shortcuts, including uxterm detection.
- Setup verifies saved GNOME accessibility settings instead of reporting an
  unverified write as success.
- Plain left element/selector clicks prefer recognized native AT-SPI activation
  actions over toolkit bounds, avoiding GTK3 HiDPI and GTK4 zero-origin pointer
  conversion when a matching action is available. Explicit coordinates, right
  clicks, and multi-clicks preserve pointer semantics.
- Clarified that relative click/scroll coordinates use the clipped window
  screenshot crop origin before preview resizing, not raw surface or widget
  coordinates, and require a window target.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- The Pi package now exposes native `computer_use_linux_*` tools without a
  separate MCP adapter. One small loader stays active initially, then uses
  Pi's additive dynamic-tool loading to expose selected tools with their exact
  generated MCP schemas only when desktop control is needed.
- Pi keeps one lazily started, session-scoped computer-use-linux process,
  forwards cancellation, serializes desktop actions, preserves image results,
  bounds text output, and rejects binary/schema version drift.

### Changed
- Pi installation is now one command (`pi install
  npm:@agent-sh/computer-use-linux`) and no longer writes
  `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json`. Existing adapter-based entries are detected and
  reported for non-destructive manual cleanup.

## [0.4.10] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- An explicitly opt-in `run_shell` MCP tool supports bounded same-user shell
  execution for trusted remote MCP deployments. The tool is absent unless
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_ENABLE_SHELL=1`, clears ambient credentials, requires
  visible environment additions, enforces timeout/output limits and process-
  group cleanup, and emits command-digest audit records.

### Fixed
- Wayland literal text now uses `wtype` on compatible compositors when portal
  keyboard input is unavailable, preserving Unicode before the ydotool
  fallback. Known-incompatible GNOME, KDE/Plasma, and COSMIC sessions do not
  advertise or select wtype, and a launched failure never replays the text.
- Absolute uinput pointer axes now end at the final logical desktop pixel, so
  edge coordinates are advertised and clamped consistently.
- Capability maps now advertise AT-SPI only when its bus is reachable and a
  toolkit accessibility status is actually enabled.
- Buttons outside the absolute uinput device's left, middle, and right set now
  fall through to a backend that can synthesize them instead of becoming left clicks.
- Temporary KWin script callbacks now accept one matching response from the
  current `org.kde.KWin` bus owner, reject spoofed or replayed responses, and
  time out the complete script transaction before cleaning up owned temporary
  state without disturbing a colliding callback registration.
- KWin window listings now classify Plasma 6 native Wayland and Xwayland
  clients when the legacy client flags are unavailable.
- GNOME extension setup now reports when changed files require an already-active
  Shell extension to reload before its newly installed DBus methods are served,
  and requires that reload when the previous extension state cannot be read.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- Bounded AT-SPI traversals now use concurrent indexed child reads, count both
  queued references and failed child lookups against their work budgets, and
  enforce a snapshot deadline so wide, malformed, or stalled accessibility
  trees cannot allocate or retain unbounded work.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed
- AT-SPI state capture now reaches deeply nested GTK4 controls such as Nautilus
  file cells by using a 1,000-node default budget and depth-32 traversal, with
  bounded 2,000-node and depth-64 limits shared by the MCP and CLI paths.
- `install.sh` now treats unavailable window-targeting or exact-focus support as
  a degraded platform capability when MCP registration, accessibility trees,
  and development input are ready, while missing core prerequisites remain hard
  failures. The same classification applies when `jq` is unavailable.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- `install.sh` now recognizes Artix as pacman-based, chooses an explicitly
  requested or unambiguous package manager for unknown distros, treats
  ydotool as an optional fallback, installs the required xdotool keyboard
  backend on X11, distinguishes pointer-only direct uinput from keyboard-ready
  input in `doctor`, reports Wayland RemoteDesktop pointer availability
  separately from its required keyboard contract, and skips automatic ydotoold
  setup when a systemd user manager is unavailable.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed
- Native X11 coordinate clicks now use one supervised
  `xdotool mousemove -- X Y click --repeat N BUTTON` command after the
  absolute pointer and eligible portal paths, with `ydotool` fallback only
  when `xdotool` cannot be spawned. Standard left, middle, and right buttons
  are supported; extended buttons retain the existing fallback path. Set
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_FORCE_YDOTOOL_POINTER=1` to skip xdotool.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- Stateful ydotool operations now complete while retaining the serialized input
  lock after caller cancellation, preventing paired button or key events from
  being interrupted. Drag also attempts button release after intermediate
  failures.
- Scaled KWin sessions now map logical window geometry through the compositor's
  virtual screen geometry while preserving logical portal input coordinates.
- Hyprland window bounds now map against grim's complete global output union,
  including negative origins and mixed or fractional scales, and are omitted
  when monitor metadata is unavailable or invalid.
- Mirrored KScreen outputs are excluded from the portal monitor layout.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- KWin window listing and activation now support both Plasma 6
  (`windowList`/`activeWindow`) and Plasma 5 (`clientList`/`activeClient`).
- ydotool is now used only when its CLI, daemon, and socket support the raw
  event semantics Computer Use emits. Compatibility probing works without
  `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, uses an isolated private socket, and rejects CLI errors
  that are returned with a successful exit status.
- X11 `xdotool type` now disables per-character delay, and a command that
  starts but fails is no longer replayed through ydotool. The ydotool fallback
  is limited to failures to launch xdotool, avoiding duplicate partial input.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed
- Hyprland window activation now checks `hyprctl dispatch` stdout instead of
  trusting its exit status, so an exit-zero `Invalid dispatcher` response falls
  through to the compatible focus dispatcher. (#62)
- Modifier chords sent through the ydotool fallback now include a 100 ms
  inter-event delay so applications such as Firefox do not drop simultaneous
  modifier and key events. (#63)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- X11 keyboard input now goes through `xdotool` (XTEST) instead of ydotool.
  ydotool injects raw evdev scancodes into a virtual uinput device, which X11
  re-interprets through the active XKB layout — so `press_key "Return"` and
  chords like `ctrl+a` landed as stray characters, and `type_text` mangled
  symbols and digits (`_` → `%`, `1` → `+`) even on a plain US layout. XTEST
  resolves keysyms against the live layout. Wayland behaviour is unchanged, and
  the ydotool path remains the fallback when `xdotool` is missing or fails.
  `doctor` now reports an `xdotool` input backend on X11. Override with
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_FORCE_YDOTOOL_KEYBOARD=1` (opt out) or
  `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_FORCE_XDOTOOL_KEYBOARD=1` (force on). (#58)
- Portal `scroll` direction on KDE Plasma Wayland: vertical discrete axis steps
  are inverted for the xdg-desktop-portal-kde discrete path so `direction:
  "up"|"down"` matches viewport motion. ydotool / REL_WHEEL polarity is
  unchanged. Override with `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_PORTAL_SCROLL_INVERT=0|1`. (#56)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Targeted `get_app_state` screenshots now crop to the resolved target window,
  and refuse the full-desktop fallback when a target was requested but window
  bounds cannot be resolved or the window is entirely off-screen. (#48)
- Hyprland window bounds are normalized against each window's monitor origin
  and fractional scale so portal screenshot coordinates align on
  multi-monitor and scaled (e.g. 1.8x/2.0x) setups. (#48)
- Wayland sessions are recognized via `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` when
  `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` is unavailable, so the portal input fallback engages in
  environments that don't export the session type. (#48)
- Window focus verification now allows up to one second for compositor
  workspace/focus transitions before reporting activation failure. (#48)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Generic X11/EWMH window backend so `list_windows`, `focused_window`,
  `activate_window`, `move_window`, and `resize_window` work on X11 window
  managers without a dedicated backend (Cinnamon/Muffin, MATE/Marco,
  Xfce/xfwm4, Openbox, and others). (#41)
- Pi coding agent extension package: `pi install npm:@agent-sh/computer-use-linux`
  now provides Linux desktop control tools through `pi-mcp-adapter`'s MCP
  proxy without a separate pi-specific skill. (#42)

### Fixed
- Hyprland 0.55 exact window focus: `activate_window` now tries the 0.55 Lua
  focus dispatcher (`hl.dsp.focus`) first and falls back to the legacy
  `focuswindow` dispatcher on older releases. (#45)
- Exported MCP tool schemas no longer carry the non-standard `uint`/`uint8`/
  `uint16`/`uint32`/`uint64`/`usize` `format` annotations emitted by
  `schemars`, which produced repeated warnings in MCP clients; integer types
  and numeric constraints are preserved. (#45)
- GNOME extension package bootstrap on Ubuntu no longer tries to install the
  nonexistent `gnome-shell-extension-tool` apt package; `gnome-shell` is
  installed only when `gnome-extensions` is missing and apt can provide it. (#40)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- A scroll with a window target but no x/y/element_index focused the window and
  then scrolled whatever sat under the cursor while reporting success.
  Window-targeted scroll now defaults its point to the centre of the resolved
  window (and errors with a pass-x/y hint when bounds are unavailable). Scroll
  results also gain the same off-screen coordinate warning click already had.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Exposed a focused Rust library surface for downstream diagnostics,
  accessibility snapshots, screenshots, and server integration while preserving
  the existing CLI binaries and standalone naming. (#35)
- Input-landing feedback: targeted keyboard input results append
  focused-element feedback from AT-SPI and warn when no editable element holds
  focus.
- Off-screen detection: screenshot, click, and input results warn when the
  target window or coordinate is partially or fully off-screen.
- Window geometry tools: `move_window` and `resize_window` via the GNOME Shell
  extension backend.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- GTK4 applications (Nautilus, Text Editor, baobab, and others) now return their
  full accessibility tree instead of a single `role: "unknown"` root with
  `child_count: 0`. Reads were routed through the `atspi` `P2P` trait's
  `object_as_accessible`, whose no-peer fallback builds a proxy with a path but
  no destination; on the shared a11y bus that fails with `ServiceUnknown` for
  any app that does not advertise a peer-to-peer bus address. Modern GTK4 apps
  do not implement the legacy `GetApplicationBusAddress`, so they hit the broken
  fallback while GTK3/Chromium/Electron apps kept working. Reads now use
  `ObjectRefExt::as_accessible_proxy`, which always pins the destination to the
  object's bus name. (#31)

## [0.2.8] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- Published a metadata-only patch release so local and downstream consumers can
  pin the already-validated `computer-use-linux` package state.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed
- Window-relative clicks now require a verified target window and resolved
  bounds before coordinates are translated, preventing clicks from silently
  landing against stale or originless window data.
- Long `ydotool type --file -` input now gets a bounded timeout with both a
  fixed process budget and a text-length budget while stdout/stderr are drained
  asynchronously.
- KDE clipboard text input now uses the session DBus API directly and waits
  long enough for large paste payloads before restoring the previous clipboard;
  Klipper proxy creation and method calls share the same bounded DBus timeout.
- Failed accessibility tree extraction clears cached nodes so later
  element-targeted actions cannot use stale coordinates.

### Changed
- The COSMIC helper source path and runtime override surface now use standalone
  `computer-use-linux` naming only.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed
- Screenshots now work from background processes (systemd user services,
  non-interactive parent shells) on GNOME Wayland. The GNOME Shell DBus method
  rejects callers that do not own an allowlisted bus name, and the XDG portal
  cancels non-interactive requests when there is no foreground window, so both
  prior backends failed in that context. `gnome-screenshot` is now a third
  capture fallback that works regardless of session context, bounded by a 20s
  timeout so a hung capture degrades to a clear error instead of blocking.

### Added
- `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_SCREENSHOT_BACKEND` to force a single screenshot backend
  (`gnome-shell`, `portal`, or `gnome-screenshot`), skipping the fallback chain
  for pinned/background deployments and debugging.
- `doctor` now probes `gnome-screenshot` and lists it under
  `capabilities.screenshot` when present.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Added build-time GNOME extension / DBus identity overrides (`CUL_*`) so the
  `codex-desktop-linux` embedded copy can share this source while keeping its
  Codex extension identity, plus runtime `CODEX_COMPUTER_USE_*` aliases for the
  embedded input/backend knobs.

### Documentation
- Cross-referenced the sibling `agent-workspace-linux` project in the README.

### Fixed
- Bounded screenshot payloads by default before returning them to MCP hosts,
  while exposing opt-in screenshot sizing controls and coordinate metadata for
  downscaled captures.
- Added opt-in JPEG screenshot output with a caller-selected quality so agents
  can choose compression before the byte cap forces additional resizing.
- Ported downstream Linux readiness fixes: `doctor` now treats direct
  `/dev/uinput` and the XDG RemoteDesktop portal as valid development-input
  backends instead of requiring `ydotoold` in every ready setup.
- Ported downstream session hydration fixes for X11 launches by carrying
  `XAUTHORITY` through environment hydration and checking the same-user namespace
  init process when it owns the graphical session environment.

### Security
- Pinned the release upload GitHub Action to a commit SHA in CI.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-05-25

Primarily a documentation release that refreshes the crates.io and npm README
pages; also bumps the MCP server's advertised version string to match.

### Added
- Documented the `screenshot` MCP tool and the `doctor` capability map, which
  were missing from the README tool list and the MCP safety-contract table.
- A new "Environment variables" section covering runtime overrides
  (`CU_DISABLE_ABS_POINTER`, the `COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_FORCE_PORTAL` /
  `FORCE_YDOTOOL` pointer and keyboard knobs) and the npm wrapper install knobs
  (`COMPUTER_USE_LINUX_BIN`, `DOWNLOAD_BASE`, `SKIP_DOWNLOAD`, `LOCAL_*`).

### Changed
- Stopped pinning explicit versions throughout the docs (README, npm README,
  Hermes skill). Install commands are now bare and download links use GitHub's
  `/releases/latest` redirect, so the docs no longer drift on every release.
- Dropped the `version` field from the Hermes skill frontmatter (optional per
  the agentskills.io standard) so it no longer mirrors the tool version.
- Friendlier README opening: warmer tagline and a verb-driven summary, with no
  sections removed.

### Fixed
- `install.sh` now reads the current `doctor` readiness schema
  (`.readiness.blockers`, empty array means ready) instead of the removed
  `.ready` / `.checks` fields, so a fully provisioned system reports ready
  instead of always failing the doctor step. Restored the `install.sh`
  executable bit. (#9)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-05-22

### Added
- A `sync reminder` CI workflow (`.github/workflows/sync-reminder.yml`) that
  opens (or updates) a `codex-sync`-labeled issue when a merge to `main` touches
  the crate sources (`src/**`, `Cargo.toml`, `gnome-shell-extension/**`), so the
  change can be propagated into the `codex-desktop-linux` embedded copy with its
  codex naming re-applied.

### Changed
- Bumped to establish version-enumeration parity with the `codex-desktop-linux`
  embedded copy (`0.2.3-linux-alpha1`). The two crates are kept on the same
  enumeration on purpose: a mismatch signals that a sync between them is pending.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Added a uinput absolute pointer (`abs_pointer.rs`) that creates a private
  `ABS_X`/`ABS_Y` device mapped to the portal screenshot coordinate space, so
  clicks land at the requested pixel on multi-monitor / HiDPI setups instead of
  being distorted by pointer acceleration and fractional scaling. Wired into
  `click()` with `ydotool` fallback; opt out via `CU_DISABLE_ABS_POINTER`.
- Added a Hermes-compatible skill tap at `skills/computer-use-linux/SKILL.md`
  and an `agnix` CI gate for agent-sh skill/config hygiene.
- Added agent-sh project-health files: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `CODEOWNERS`.
- Synced upstream Linux Computer Use text-input improvements: Wayland remote
  desktop portal keyboard sessions, KDE/Plasma clipboard paste fallback for
  layout-safe `type_text`, and literal keysym typing on non-KDE Wayland
  sessions before falling back to `ydotool`.
- Synced upstream Hyprland/session hydration fixes, including systemd user
  environment discovery, common command path hydration, `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE`
  inference, and rounded window-id disambiguation.

### Fixed
- Omitted the debug-only `received` echo field from the generated MCP
  `outputSchema` for `ActionOutput` and `ActivateWindowOutput`. `schemars`
  serialized `Option<serde_json::Value>` as the boolean schema `true`, which
  strict MCP clients (mcphub, Claude Desktop, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`'s
  `AssertObjectSchema`) reject, failing the whole `tools/list` response.
  Affected `click`, `drag`, `perform_action`, `press_key`, `scroll`,
  `set_value`, `type_text`, and `activate_window`. (#1)

### Changed
- Updated repository, release, package, and CI links from `avifenesh` to the
  `agent-sh/computer-use-linux` org repo.
- `setup_accessibility` and `doctor` now understand the AT-SPI
  `org.a11y.Status IsEnabled` path in addition to GNOME toolkit accessibility.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- npm wrapper package (`@agent-sh/computer-use-linux`) for Node.js users. It
  downloads and verifies the matching GitHub release binaries at install time.
- Tag-driven GitHub Actions publishing for crates.io and npm using repository
  secrets.
- CI release gates for locked Rust checks, clippy, tests, private rustdoc,
  cargo publish dry-run, cargo audit, npm wrapper smoke tests, and an MCP
  protocol/safety contract check.
- MCP `ToolAnnotations` that mark read-only observation tools separately from
  mutating desktop-control tools.

### Changed
- Switch the COSMIC protocol dependency from a pinned Git revision to the
  published `cosmic-protocols` `0.2.0` crate so `computer-use-linux` can be
  published on crates.io.
- Ship the `computer-use-linux-cosmic` helper alongside prebuilt release
  binaries and install it from `install.sh` so COSMIC window targeting works
  outside `cargo install`.
- Keep the MCP `serverInfo.version` aligned with the Cargo package version.
- Remove unused direct `libc` and `png` dependencies from the crate manifest.

### Documentation
- Add Hermes Agent CLI setup commands and clarify the registered MCP tool
  names / toolset.
- Add npm install instructions and fix the prebuilt binary install example to
  match the release assets, which are raw binaries with `.sha256` files rather
  than tar archives.
- Document the mutating-tool safety contract for MCP hosts and npm users.
- Pin README and npm README install examples to the released `0.2.1` packages
  and `v0.2.1` GitHub release assets.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added
- **Multi-compositor window targeting**: native backends for **KWin**
  (KDE Plasma), **Hyprland**, **i3**, and **COSMIC** Wayland alongside
  the existing GNOME Shell backend. Window listing, focus tracking, and
  activation now work across all five compositors with automatic backend
  selection at runtime.
- **COSMIC Wayland helper** (`computer-use-linux-cosmic` binary) that
  speaks the `zcosmic_toplevel_info_v1` and `zcosmic_toplevel_manager_v1`
  protocols, used by the main server when running under COSMIC.
- **`windowing/` crate-internal module** consolidating all backends behind
  a uniform `WindowBackend` trait, with a registry that picks the right
  backend per session.
- **Datagram ydotool socket support** in addition to the existing stream
  sockets. Aligns with `ydotoold`'s newer default and avoids a
  reconnection penalty per input event.
- **Raw-keycode keyboard input** path for ydotool, fixing keystroke
  delivery on layouts where the symbolic keysym path was unreliable.
- **Compact Linux accessibility trees** in `get_app_state` — deduplicated
  redundant container nodes for smaller, more focused snapshots.
- **Enriched AT-SPI state readback** — element states (`focused`,
  `selected`, `expanded`, `checked`, …) now flow through to the response
  schema for `get_app_state`.

### Changed
- Server-side rejection of empty window-backend results (returns a
  structured "no backend available" error instead of an empty list).
- Stale-client eviction in the chrome-extension host path on backend
  side (host binary itself not shipped here — see Removed).

### Removed
- **`codex-chrome-extension-host` binary** is intentionally not shipped
  in this fork — it is a Chrome native messaging host scoped to Codex
  browser automation (`com.openai.codexextension`), unrelated to the
  computer-use MCP. The cosmic helper binary is renamed to
  `computer-use-linux-cosmic` to match the project naming.

### Synced from upstream
- This release tracks
  [`ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux`](https://github.com/ilysenko/codex-desktop-linux)
  through commit `4d6fd96` (May 2026), then re-applies the rebrand
  (DBus names, env vars, GNOME extension UUID, cache-file prefixes).
  Upstream credit goes to ilysenko, mosesmrima, PinguuSS, and the
  original Codex contributors.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added
- Initial public release as a standalone repository, extracted from
  [`codex-desktop-linux-local-stack`](https://github.com/avifenesh/codex-desktop-linux).
- Linux Computer Use MCP server (`computer-use-linux` binary) speaking
  [rmcp](https://docs.rs/rmcp) over stdio.
- 15 MCP tools: `doctor`, `setup_accessibility`, `setup_window_targeting`,
  `list_apps`, `get_app_state`, `list_windows`, `focused_window`,
  `activate_window`, `click`, `drag`, `scroll`, `press_key`, `type_text`,
  `perform_action`, `set_value`.
- AT-SPI accessibility tree with semantic element selectors (role / name /
  text / states) for `click`, `perform_action`, and `set_value`.
- GNOME Shell window targeting via the bundled
  `computer-use-linux@avifenesh.dev` Shell extension (DBus service
  `dev.avifenesh.ComputerUseLinux.WindowControl`), with automatic fallback to
  `org.gnome.Shell.Introspect` when the extension is not installed.
- Screenshot capture through GNOME Shell DBus (preferred) and
  `org.freedesktop.portal.Screenshot` (fallback). Supports full-screen,
  per-app, per-window, region, and per-element scopes.
- Input synthesis through the Wayland remote-desktop portal when available,
  falling back to `ydotool` / `ydotoold` for keystrokes and pointer events.
- Best-effort terminal-window enrichment: maps each terminal window to its
  active TTY and foreground process for targeted `type_text` / `press_key`.
- `doctor` subcommand reporting AT-SPI bus health, GNOME Shell introspection
  status, extension status, ydotool socket readiness, and portal coverage in
  a single JSON document.

### Architecture
- Wayland-first; X11 best-effort through AT-SPI + ydotool.
- Validated against GNOME 50.1 on Wayland (Ubuntu 25.10).
- KDE / Sway / Hyprland untested — see README support matrix.
